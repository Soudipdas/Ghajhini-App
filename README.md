#WHY SOLVE FOR ALZHEIMER PATIENTS
#We are building for a disease that is becoming more common in day-to-day life called Alzheimer's (a continuous decline in thinking, behavioral and social skills that affects a person's ability to function independently ) or forgetting even the slightest of things.
#Over time this has devastating effects on the person's family as the patient's condition worsens and becomes more dependent on others.
#As of now, there doesn't exist any solution to fully assist Alzheimer patients hence we sought out to develop one.
#Over the period of 24 hours, we managed to build a robust app to recognize users based on their faces. This app is an assistant for patients dealing with Alzheimer which when installed by the user allows them to rectify their memory loss by keeping their data as a reminder for later usage and be able to live independently. One of the common fears of Alzheimer's patients is that they cannot trust people they don't recognize and can't believe want other claims to be. Hence we added a feature that can recognize a person's face based on previously saved images. This helps them to Identify friends and relatives. But that's not it, we also added a reminder feature that notifies patients to check their phones regularly so that they can build their memory as well as the fact that this app can help them identify people. Also, this app serves as a memory-building tool by incorporating games that help in developing the memory strength of the brain and mental conditioning.
